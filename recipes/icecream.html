    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy recipe to make a plain ice cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 cups half-and-half cream</li>
        <li>8 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>â…› teaspoon salt
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the heavy cream and half-and-half cream into a heavy saucepan, place over medium-low heat, and heat until barely simmering, stirring frequently. Turn the heat down to low.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour about 1/2 cup of hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Repeat three times more, whisking thoroughly before adding each additional 1/2 cup of hot cream to the egg yolk mixture. Pour the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining hot cream, and whisk constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens and will coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes. Do not let mixture boil.</li>
       <li>Pour the ice cream base into a bowl and allow to cool for about 20 minutes; place in refrigerator and chill overnight. The next day, pour into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's directions. Remove the ice cream, pack into a covered container, and freeze for 2 hours or overnight before serving.</li>
    </ol>
